Azure API Management is a platform-as-a-service that provides a hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts). It supports the complete API lifecycle and helps customers manage APIs as first-class assets throughout their lifecycle [1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts).

**Activate GenAI with Azure** uses API Management to manage exposed endpoints, for example, Azure OpenAI, Azure Function and Azure Cognitive Search index.
